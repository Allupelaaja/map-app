## Instructions:

Clicking on the map opens a popup menu for adding a new marker on the map.

Desktop: The list of all placed markers is located on the left side of the screen. 

Mobile: The list of all placed markers is opened by pressing the 'View' button on the top right of the screen. Pressing the 'View' button again returns the user to the map screen.

From the list menu the user can click on markers to locate them on the map, and also delete markers by pressing on the 'Remove marker' button. The 'Clear all markers' button removes all of the placed markers from the map.

All markers persist when refreshing the page, but disappear when the page is closed. (Session storage)
